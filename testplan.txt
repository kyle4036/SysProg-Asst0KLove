to make sure the pointer functions worked I ran the code following code to test it
//this is all temporary for testing purposes
  llChar charList;
  llChar* head;
  charList.data = '0';
  head = &charList;
  printf("character 0 :: %c ::\n",charList.data);
  int i;
  for(i = 0;i < 5;i++){
    pushChar(i+'a', &head);
    printf("head address after pushChar %x\n", head);
    printf("#%d:character %c :: %c ::\n",i,i+'a',(*head).data);
    printf("next char :: %c :: \n", (*(*head).next).data);
    if(i > 0){
      printf("next, next char :: %c :: \n", (*(*(*head).next).next).data);
    }
  }
  //printf("next, next char :: %c :: \n", (*(*charList.next).next).data);

  this code creates the characters from a to e and pushes them all onto the stack.
  I was having trouble figuring out how to implement a linked list, but figured it out
  eventually
